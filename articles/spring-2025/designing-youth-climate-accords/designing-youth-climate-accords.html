          When Boston's Youth Action Board proposed a binding climate accord in 2023, city staffers expected symbolic demands. Instead, the board delivered a 46-page policy blueprint grounded in transit data, energy modeling, and testimonies from bus riders. That template has since informed youth-authored accords in Lagos and São Paulo, cities with radically different transit realities but similar commitments to co-governance.

        <p>
          This article tracks how students structured their coalitions, negotiated with city agencies, and translated community listening sessions into actionable legislation. It also highlights the moments when adult allies ceded decision-making power and when they didn't—revealing the limitations of advisory-only approaches.

        <h2>Field notes from Boston</h2>
        <p>
          The Boston team split into data, storytelling, and policy pods. The data pod created heat-maps of bus reliability; storytelling pods produced commuter diaries; policy pods drafted ordinance language. Their breakthrough came when they paired the diaries with heat-maps, illustrating how delays disproportionately affected Black students in Dorchester.
        </p>
        <h2>Lessons from Lagos</h2>
        <p>
          In Lagos, students navigated limited public data by running community air-monitoring clinics. They leaned on university mentors for calibration while insisting that youth researchers lead the outreach. The resulting accord included a youth-managed climate resilience fund funded by congestion pricing.
        </p>
        <h2>São Paulo's coalition</h2>
        <p>
          São Paulo's student coalition wove in Indigenous land stewards, positioning climate action as land rematriation. They staged design studios in metro stations, inviting commuters to annotate printouts of bus routes with lived experience. The final accord recommended rerouting two rapid bus corridors and embedding land acknowledgment signage at major transit hubs.

        <p>
          Youth coalitions are now federating across continents, sharing legal templates and data infrastructure. The Student Opinion is helping convene quarterly retrospectives so that students can analyze victories and setbacks together.
